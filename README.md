# 3DSceneSemantization
Automatic tagging of a 3D scene using semantization of objects. Find here the main parts of the project presented for my Master in computer science. Might be useful for those who want to use OWLAPI (Setting up, advanced use of the OWLAPI and the Pellet reasoner in ontologyOperations.java class).
Full detail of the project (french only, sorry!) can be find in the corresponding master's thesis (page 16 -> 29):
