# 3DSceneSemantization
Automatic tagging of a 3D scene using semantization of objects. These files are the main parts of my Master thesis project in computer science. Might be useful for OWLAPI users (Setting up, advanced use of the OWLAPI and the Pellet reasoner in ontologyOperations.java class).
Full detail of the project (french only, sorry!) can be find in the corresponding master's thesis (page 16 -> 29):
